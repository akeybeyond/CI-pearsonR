First we use Fisher's r-to-z transformation which is as follow:

$$
z = 0.5 ln(\dfrac{1+r}{1-r})
$$

z is approximately normally distributed, with an  expectation equal to 

$$
0.5 ln(\dfrac{1+p}{1-p})
$$
where p is the population correlation of which r is an estimate of. The standard deviation is 
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{n-3}}
$$

So we can obtain confidence intervals using 

$$
z \pm (z-value)(\sigma)
$$


We can turn this into a function to make use of this transformation.

```{r}
rtoz <- function(pearson_r){
  0.5*log((1+pearson_r)/(1-pearson_r))
  
}

rtoz_ci <- function(pearson_r, n, z_value){
  r = rtoz(pearson_r)
  sd = sqrt(1/(n-3))
  ci_low = round(r - sd*z_value,2)
  ci_high = round(r + sd*z_value,2)
  ci = c(ci_low, ci_high)
  return(ci)
}
```
